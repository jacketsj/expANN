Set perf_event_paranoid to 0:
sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=0

Run perf record (via macros.vim) with <leader>u
Run hotspot to get a gui
:term hotspot


Alternatively:
<leader>i for callgrind+kcachegrind (https://anti-hirnsieb.blogspot.com/2011/06/howto-profile-c-app.html)
Maybe use this too: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32905212/how-to-use-kcachegrind-and-callgrind-to-measure-only-parts-of-my-code
with <leader>I
Note that valgrind doesn't support some instructions that libeigen uses. Need to edit CMakeLists to use certain architectures.
